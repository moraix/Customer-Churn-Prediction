# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses deep learning to predict customer churn based on various features.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains customer information and churn labels (0 = Not Churn, 1 = Churn).
- Class imbalance was handled using **SMOTE** and **class weighting**.

## 🛠️ Model & Techniques
- **Deep Learning (Keras & TensorFlow)**
- **Feature Scaling** with StandardScaler
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy

## 📊 Results
- **Test Accuracy:** 87.41%
- **Recall (Churn Class):** 63%

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Tune hyperparameters further.
- Try different architectures like tree-based models.
